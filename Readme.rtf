Phishing URL Detection with Machine Learning

This repository contains Python scripts for detecting phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. 
It includes feature extraction (extract_features.py), logistic regression (Logistic_Regression_Pytorch.py), and a deep neural network (deep_neural_network.py). 
Features extracted from URLs include TF-IDF representations, IP address detection, URL length analysis, and identification of suspicious top-level domains. 
The logistic regression model predicts JavaScript presence, while the deep neural network handles regression tasks. 
Results showcase the neural network's effectiveness in cybersecurity pattern recognition. The project addresses challenges in data preprocessing and model optimization, emphasizing practical application in enhancing URL security measures. 
Leveraging external datasets and tools like ChatGPT for guidance, this project aims to advance phishing detection capabilities through machine learning.
